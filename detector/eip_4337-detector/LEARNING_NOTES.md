# EIP-4337 Findings - Full Learning Notes

Source: `extracted_from_api/useful_tags_findings/eip_4337.json`

- Total findings: 0
- Impact distribution: 

## Coverage Confirmation

All findings in this tag file were processed (full-file learning, no sampling).

## Repeated Signals

1. Limited textual signal due to low/zero findings; detector relies on conservative baseline checks.

## Frequent Action Surfaces

1. No dominant action surface extracted from content; use broad state-transition review.

## Representative Function Mentions

1. No stable function-name pattern extracted.

## Detector Design Inputs

1. Prioritize high-impact state transitions first.
2. Track authorization, accounting, and external interaction boundaries around tag-related logic.
3. Validate invariant preservation before and after user-controlled operations.
